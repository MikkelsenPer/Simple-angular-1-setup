# Simple-angular-1-setup
This project will guide you through a simple setup. The project contains simple code but the purpose is to learn to setup an angular project.

The project is created in AngularJS 1.5.5 and with npm/NodeJS.

All you need to do is to download the code/project and follow the guide on the wiki and then you should have a simple angular project set up in 5 min and be ready to code :-)
